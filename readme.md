# Hypercloud: p2p + ‚òÅ 

Hypercloud is getting improved!

#### [Read the Proposed spec discussion](https://hackmd.io/s/HJHPnsBNl)

Hypercloud is a "high-availability" server for Dat archives. Hypercloud archives are discoverable over both the Dat network and http. Hypercloud is also fully replicable! Hyperclouds can be backed up or seeded to other peers, duplicating up all of the contents in each cloud.

Hypercloud will also have user management and profiles via Dat.
